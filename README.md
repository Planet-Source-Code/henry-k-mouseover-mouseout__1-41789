## MouseOver/MouseOut


</div>

### Description

After a long search.. and trying, finally this is the code for detecting mouseover and mouseout events. Comes in handy when you have a sidebar by example. This is the first time i upload something, this because i expect other programmers searched (and did not find) anything like this. It's not the most clean code, but it gives you the idea.
 
### More Info
 
Use lastindex.. so click events are fully processed instead of processing his mouseover.
